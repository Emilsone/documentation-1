Suggested Features to Improve connext Developer Documentation

### Search Bar Functionality
If you have a lot of information on your documentation, adding a search bar functionality will help the user to access whatever information they want to access on the documentation quickly without having to navigate through the menu.

### Documentation version
Version control is a method of managing multiple variations of the same document, particularly when it is important to keep a clear record of how the document was created, developed, and changed over time. Having a different version of your documentation will help the developers and users know the latest code update of this documentation.

### Document Translation
Having a Translated version of your document will help international users who don't speak or understand English to work with your documentation at ease 

### Programming Language-Specific guide
If your document has some code samples or snippets that solve a problem or explain about your product then it is best to have great documentation that will meet the developers where they are, providing specific instructions tailored to the language or even framework the developer has already chosen.
